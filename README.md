#### Message from the tutors
Dear participants

Thank you for your interest in the "Reasoning under uncertainty" workshop. 

This is to provide a heads up on the toolchain we will be using for the hands-on parts of the workshop. Please do have these installed on your computing device - it will save us time during the workshop.

- Anaconda distribution from Continuum Analytics
- [Lea](https://bitbucket.org/piedenis/lea)
- [Pomegranate](https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate)
- [OpenPNL](https://bitbucket.org/joaopccosta/pnl-probabilistic-networks-library-fixed.git)

Please install the **latest versions from the repositories** rather than precompiled versions from packages. The older versions **do not** have all the needed functionality.

If there are any difficulties in installing OpenPNL, please open an issue at [https://github.com/ValueFromData/PyPNL](https://github.com/ValueFromData/PyPNL) - one of us will help you resolve the problem.

We will make [PyPNL](https://github.com/ValueFromData/PyPNL), a Python probabilistic inference and learning framework that we are developing, available for download and installation in the next few days. This will be used extensively in the workshop.

In addition, material relevant to the workshop is available at
